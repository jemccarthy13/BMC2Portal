## Frontend Developer Quick Start

- Primary: Run `make frontend-dev` to install and start a hotloading development environment.

- Manually:
1. Install npm or yarn 
2. In bmc2porta/src, add a .env with the following:
REACT_APP_SERVER_BASE_URL=FRONTEND
3. cd bmc2portal/src
4. `npm install && npm run start` to launch frontend only web app

This frontend UI was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Assuming you have installed npm and/or yarn, the following scripts are available.

(Note: replace yarn with npm if npm is your preffered package manager).

### `yarn install`

Required be run before any other script to download and install dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
